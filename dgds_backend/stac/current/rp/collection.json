The return periods are derived from a 38 year reanalysis with the GTSM, using ERA5 meteorology as input and with a Gumbel model fitted to the data. See [the Wiki](https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/display/BED/References) for further information about the GTSM, this reanalysis and further climate change scenarios carried out using this model.",
