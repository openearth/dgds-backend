These scenario analysis can help developing strategies and evaluating the effectiveness of the mitigation options for the numerous pollutants. This indicator can be linked to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 6.3.2 “Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality”. Values below 0.05 (meaning <5% of species are expected to be lost) represent a low risk and can be seen as a good ambient water quality (shown on the maps as green areas). The Toxic stress results are available on a detailed geographical scale (1 km x 1 km), free to download and use and can be aggregated easily to large areas like river basins or countries, making it suitable for many purposes for international organisations, governments, river basin commissions, consultants and other stakeholders.",
